General Information: 
This website was created by Jason Han as part of coursework for Environmental Studies 193DS at UC Santa Barbara.
The site was built using RStudio and Quarto, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
It showcases my hometown, a collection of resources for Environmental Studies students, my resume, and a personal blog.
The data used in the Data Visualization blog was personally collected by me.
My data visualization explores whether I take more steps on average during school days compared to non-school days.
For my data visualization I addresed if on average I take more steps on days I go to school versus days donâ€™t.
I analyzed the data by calculating summary statistics, generating a jitter plot, and creating a summary table.

Data:
All my .yml, .qmd, and .css files are located in the root directory of ButterEggs.github.io. Media files are stored in the /media/ folder, and blog posts are in the /blog/ folder.
