##### Here are some resources I found useful that all Environmental Studies Majors should have!

[Environmental Studies degrees that are offered at UCSB](https://es.ucsb.edu/index.php/degrees)

[Environmental Studies courses offered, the proposed courses for the year, and the syllabus from previous years of Environmental Studies courses](https://es.ucsb.edu/courses)

[Nexus grades used for seeing the grade distributions of all classes over the years at UCSB](https://dailynexus.com/interactives/grades/)

[UCSB Platinum used for planning classes, better than UCSB gold](https://ucsbplat.com/)

[Degree requirements including GEs, Special Subject Areas, and University requirements](https://www.duels.ucsb.edu/degree-planning/degree-requirements)

[assist.org used for finding what classes are able to be transferred from community colleges](assist.org)

[cvc.edu used for searching classes that are able to fulfill GE requirements by using key words in the name of certain classes](cvc.edu)

##### My advice:

-   Take as many classes that are transferable such as GEs and intro classes at a Community College.

-   Prioritize Environmental Studies classes that interest you, have highly rated professors, and small class sizes that fill up fast.

-   Take classes that cover multiple areas such as, one GE, one special requirement, and one university requirement at the same time to maximize efficiency.

-   Find internships early on in year one.
